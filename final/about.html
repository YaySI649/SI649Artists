     <h1>Summary</h1>
     <p>
       Using data from Last.fm, we are interested in visualizing trends that exist between 
artists' genre, popularity, and concert tours. By visualizing this data on a map, we reveal 
the distinct patterns that emerge between artists of different genres and their concert 
tours. We hypothesized that R&B artists and Country artists would not have the similar 
concert routes. We also hypothesized that distinct trends would appear between artists 
that differed in popularity, such as major Pop artists and small Indie bands. The data we 
have collected dates back to 1960, which allows us to also incorporate temporal data 
into our visualization  
     </p>
     <p>
         By including temporal data, we wanted to visualize trends of cultural and historical 
significance, such as expansion of certain genres and the growth and normalization 
of international tours. Besides just fueling random human interest, this visualization 
reveals information about types of music (especially Western music) and how that 
music interacts with the rest of the world. Although we have faced some challenges with 
our data (addressed in our Discussions sections) we believe the mapping of concert 
tours contributes to ethnographic study.
     </p>
     <p>
        The contribution of this work is to connect music data and geographic data for the 
purpose of analysis. We aim to derive information about culture, music genres, and 
concert tours over time. We have pulled user generated data and re-contextualized this 
data upon a map, this reveals not only interesting relationships and patterns but also 
reveals greater cultural implications in time.

     <h1>Data Source and Technologies</h1>
            <p>All artist tour data is collected from Last.fm API using Python Scripts. Key technologies in realizing this software are: Javascript, jQuery, D3.js, 
                Leaflet Map, WebSQL, HTML/CSS</p>
